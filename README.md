## Idea Defaults
edits the .idea config files for IntelliJ projects. This is currently set to change all of the window info lines to auto hide.

```
python idea_defaults.py path/to/project
```

The path should be the parent directory for the idea folder. If no directory is supplied then the script looks for it in the current directory.
