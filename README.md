Random scripts and utilities

## Idea Defaults
Edits the .idea config files for IntelliJ projects. This is currently set to change all of the window info lines to auto hide.

```
python idea_defaults.py path/to/project
```

The path should be the parent directory for the idea folder. If no directory is supplied then the script looks for it in the current directory.

## Newline Nuker
Removes those pesky carriage returns (carriage return nuker just didn't have the same ring).

```
python newline_nuker.py
```
