# exercise activity calculator

For Exercise activities:
1. Download a csv of activities from [Garmin Connect](https://connect.garmin.com/modern/activities) and name the file activities.csv. You may need to scroll down in the UI until you have loaded all of the activities you wish to download because it currently only downloads what you have loaded.

2. Run `python garmin.py` to get a list of the number of activities and the time spent doing them for each activity type.

For Meditation:
1. Export the logs from InsightTimer app and save the file as InsightTimerLogs.csv

2. Run `python meditation.py` to get a list of the number of times meditated and the time spent.
