1. Download a csv of activities from [Garmin Connect](https://connect.garmin.com/modern/activities) and name the file activities.csv. You may need to scroll down in the UI until you have loaded all of the activities you wish to download because it currently only downloads what you have loaded.

2. Run `python calculator.py` to get a list of the number of activities and the time spent doing them for each activity type.
